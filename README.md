## School_District_Analysis
# Overview of School District Analysis
This purpose of this analysis was to figure out how claims of academic misconduct could alter district-wide data and also how one can use Jupyters Notebook and Pandas to efficiently provide that information from a massive amount of data.

# Results
Not much changed from district summary data, the lowest performing schools, the average reading scores, school size summary, and school type data, as many of these values run independent of test scores. However, the percent of students passing their reading and math courses drastically fell when 9th graders were removed from the data set. Furthermore, Thomas High Schools ranking among district schools plumetted once 9th grades were not accounted for. 

# Summary
We did find math and reading performance average went down whent 9th gradeers were removed from the count, as well as note that upperclassmen spend more money per student then Thomas High School freshmen do.
